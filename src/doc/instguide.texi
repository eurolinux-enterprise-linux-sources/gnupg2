@chapter A short installation guide.


Unfortunately the installation guide has not been finished in time.
Instead of delaying the release of GnuPG 2.0 even further, I decided to
release without that guide.  The chapter on gpg-agent and gpgsm do
include brief information on how to set up the whole thing.  Please
watch the GnuPG website for updates of the documentation.  In the
meantime you may search the GnuPG mailing list archives or ask on the
gnupg-users mailing listsfor advise on how to solve problems or how to
get that whole thing up and running. 

Such questions may also help to write a proper installation guide.

** Explain how to setup a root CA key as trusted

X.509 is based on a hierarchical key infrastructure.  At the root of the
tree a trusted anchor (root certificate) is required.  There are usually
no other means of verifying whether this root certificate is trustworthy
than looking it up in a list. GnuPG uses a file (@file{trustlist.txt})
to keep track of all root certificates it knows about.  There are 3 ways
to get certificates into this list:

@itemize
@item
Use the list which comes with GnuPG. However this list only
contains a few root certificates.  Most installations will need more.

@item
Let @command{gpgsm} ask you whether you want to insert a new root
certificate.  To enable this feature you need to set the option
@option{allow-mark-trusted} into @file{gpg-agent.conf}.  In general it
is not a good idea to do it this way.  Checking whether a root
certificate is really trustworthy requires decisions, which casual
users are not up to.  Thus, by default this option is not enabled.

@item 
Manually maintain the list of trusted root certificates. For a multi
user installation this can be done once for all users on a machine.
Specific changes on a per-user base are also possible.

XXX decribe how to maintain trustlist.txt and /etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt.
